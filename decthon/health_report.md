It's important that you seek medical consultation since your fever and cold symptoms could be indicative of various conditions, possibly a viral or bacterial infection, or even COVID-19. I have booked a consultation for you using Practo. A doctor will get in touch with you shortly for further analysis and to prescribe an appropriate treatment plan. In the meanwhile, stay hydrated, rest well, and monitor your symptoms closely. If you feel your symptoms are worsening, please seek immediate medical attention.
